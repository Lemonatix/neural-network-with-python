# Neural Network with Python 
(note: building the network with all the required files is still in progress, some parts mentioned in the README.md won't be implemented from the start.)

A beginner-friendly project to implement neural networks from scratch using Python. This repository demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization, without relying on advanced libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Although TensorFlow and PyTorch might be used to show how those advanced libralies can be used properly. 

## Features
- Implementation of a basic feedforward neural network
- Customizable number of layers and neurons
- Simple activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.)
- Gradient descent for optimization
- Example datasets for training and testing

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-with-python.git
   cd neural-network-with-python
   ```

2. Run the main script to see the neural network in action:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Usage

### Training on Example Dataset

The script includes a simple dataset for demonstration purposes. You can customize the parameters in the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.01,
  "epochs": 1000,
  "hidden_layers": [16, 8]
}
```

### Visualizing Results

Results such as training loss and accuracy are visualized using Matplotlib:

- Training Loss vs. Epochs
- Decision Boundary for Classification Problems
